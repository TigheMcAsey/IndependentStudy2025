# Independent Study 2025

One immediate limitation of this repository is that it aims to record something better done by hand. Like most "resolutions" happening around New Years, this project aims to do something optimistic, assuming I will have the time and effort to record a small amount of what I learn, and include a few details from the problems I solve so I may return on future occasions and better understand my thought process regarding them.

I hope to provide myself with a few brief notes on what I learn studying on my own this year for future reference. It takes an immense amount of effort to cram all of this math in my brain so it would be a shame if I were to forget it.
